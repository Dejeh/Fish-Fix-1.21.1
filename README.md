What is Fish Fix?
=================

This is a mod for NeoForge 1.21.1. It addresses this bug in particular: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-226687. It simply fixes the consequences of the hardcoded "getSeaLevel" method by allowing the user to set their own sea level.
This bug was fixed in 1.21.2.

This mod is primarily useful for datapack and modpack creators, or anyone who modifies world generation with the ocean in mind.
By default, the mod uses the game's hardcoded values; they must be changed in the config for any practical effect.

I do plan on backporting this mod.

**To be clear: this mod does not allow you to modify sea level. This must be done separately.**
